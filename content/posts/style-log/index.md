## First Look

Every time the season changes, I always complain that I have nothing to wear, even though the clothes in my wardrobe haven't decreased. 

So I decided to keep this style log as a reminder for style inspiration and also as a record of my life.

## Outfit

### 2025 Autumn/Winter

#### Look 1

- Coat: Zara 7380422 800
- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW
- Shoes: Birkenstock Boston

This coat's fabric is amazingâ€”very light and thin. It has a belt (although it doesn't seem obvious in the photo). It's my favorite piece this year.

#### Look 2

- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW

This is a very easy-to-match outfit. It will often appears in other outfits as a base layer.

And I really love the tabi socks for the flip-flops.

#### Look 3

- Coat: Zara 9621905 809
- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW

The coat somewhat looks it came out of Star Wars.

#### Look 4

- Coat: Muji Chester Coat 2024

#### Look 5

- Coat: Uniqlo 479417
- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW
- Shoes: Birkenstock Boston

This coat is from this year's Uniqlo U collection. The tailoring is very cool, but personally, I think the packable hood is a bit unnecessary.

#### Look 6

- Coat: JUNRED
- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW
- Shoes: Birkenstock Boston

The coat was bought in Tokio, Japan. It's made of denim, curly but cool.

Just found out that the brand is closed. Sad.

#### Look 7

- Coat: Zara 3918357 800
- T-Shirt: Uniqlo 476216
- Pants: OPICLOTH/OPIC 21AW
- Shoes: Birkenstock Boston

This jacket is double-layered, with a detachable padded lining, making it very warm.

I have worn it for two years, and it keeps me warm even in cold winters.

Claw clips are really useful for my curly and messy hair.
