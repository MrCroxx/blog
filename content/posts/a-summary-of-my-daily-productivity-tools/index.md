## 0. New year, new journey

At the beginning of 2026, I happened to get a chance to rethink and reshape my productivity toolchain on macOS.

Before that, I just want to clairfy that I don’t actively update my productivity toolkit. I value consistency and stability in my workflow much more than fancy features. This time I’m restructuring my toolkit because after upgrading my MacBook Air M2 to macOS 26, I’ve been experiencing intermittent DNS resolution issues with Wi-Fi connections. I finally found the time and a reason to re‑examine the tools I use.

This toolkit list is both my recommendation and a memo for myself when I need to reconfigure my environment in the future.
